### Hi! I'm [@Barsik-Marsik](https://github.com/Barsik-Marsik) (Ilya Zorin).

I studied automation, mechatronics and robotics at [@NNSTU](https://en.nntu.ru/). I'm currently studying software development at [@Ya.Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.com).

I love learning new things and technologies. 

**I believe that space flights will become a reality!** :rocket:
